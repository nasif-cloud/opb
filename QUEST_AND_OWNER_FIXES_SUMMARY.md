   - üìä **Bot Statistics**: Stats, user lists, user info
   - üéÆ **Game Management**: Spawn cards, give items, test pulls
   - üóÑÔ∏è **Database Operations**: Cleanup, backup, counts

3. **Working Commands Implemented**:
   - `op owner give @user <amount> <beli/xp>`
   - `op owner give @user card <card_name> <rank>`
   - `op owner reset @user`
   - `op owner ban @user [reason]` / `op owner unban @user`
   - `op owner stats` - Comprehensive bot statistics
   - `op owner userlist [page]` - Paginated user list
   - `op owner userinfo @user` - Detailed user information
   - `op owner spawn <card_name> <rank>` - Spawn cards for testing
   - `op owner item <item_name>` - Give items for testing
   - `op owner cleanup` - Remove inactive users
   - `op owner count` - Database statistics

4. **Removed Non-Working Commands**:
   - Removed reload, shutdown, announce (not implemented)
   - Removed event management (not implemented)
   - Removed rate modification (not implemented)
   - Removed raw MongoDB query (security risk)

### Enhanced Features:
- **Proper Card Creation**: All card objects now include complete schema (experience, locked, etc.)
- **Better Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and validation
- **Security**: Owner-only access with proper validation
- **Performance Stats**: Memory usage, uptime, user activity tracking

2. **Battle Quests**: Win battles and check quest completion
3. **Explore Quests**: Complete exploration steps and verify tracking
4. **Market Quests**: Buy/sell items and confirm quest progress
5. **Evolution Quests**: Evolve cards and check quest completion
