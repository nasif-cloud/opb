# Equipment and Market Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### Bug #1: Equipment Not Showing for Some Users

**Problem**: Users reported that equipment was working for some users but not others. The equipment would appear equipped but not show properly in commands.

**Root Cause**: 
1. In `commands/unequip.js`, when unequipping items, the item name was added directly to inventory without normalization
2. However, when equipping items, they are normalized (lowercase, no spaces) before being stored
3. This created a mismatch where the inventory would contain non-normalized item names that couldn't be found by the equip command
4. Missing `markModified('equipped')` call could also cause save issues with the Mixed type

**Files Fixed**:
- `commands/unequip.js`

**Changes Made**:
- Added proper normalization when returning items to inventory: `user.inventory.push(normalize(equippedItem))`
- Added missing `markModified` calls for both `equipped` and `inventory` fields
- Improved error handling and code consistency

### Bug #2: Market Purchase Not Giving Items to Buyers

**Problem**: A user bought a level 2 S rank card from the market but didn't receive it in their collection.

**Root Cause**:
1. In `commands/market.js` purchase function, when adding cards to buyer's collection, the card object was missing required properties:
   - Missing `experience: 0` field
   - Missing `locked: false` field
2. Missing `markModified` calls for `cards` and `inventory` arrays, which are required when modifying arrays in Mongoose Mixed types
3. Inconsistency between market purchase implementations

**Files Fixed**:
- `commands/market.js` (both `handleMarketBuy` and `handleMarketUnlist` functions)

**Changes Made**:
- Added missing card properties when creating card objects:
  ```javascript
  user.cards.push({
      name: listing.itemName,
      rank: listing.itemRank,
      level: listing.itemLevel || 1,
      experience: 0,           // Added
      timesUpgraded: 0,
      locked: false            // Added
  });
  ```
- Added proper `markModified` calls for arrays:
  ```javascript
  user.markModified('cards');
  user.markModified('inventory');
  ```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Equipment Testing**:
   - Equip an item to a card
   - Unequip the item
   - Verify the item appears in inventory with proper normalization
   - Re-equip the same item to ensure it works

2. **Market Testing**:
   - List a card on the market
   - Purchase the card with a different user
   - Verify the card appears in buyer's collection with all properties
   - Check that the card shows up in `op collection` and `op mycard` commands

## Notes

- These fixes ensure data consistency across the equipment and market systems
- The normalization approach keeps items consistent throughout the codebase
- Proper `markModified` calls are crucial for Mongoose Mixed types and arrays
- All card objects now include required fields preventing undefined property issues

## Additional Fixes Applied

During the investigation, I found similar missing property issues in other commands that create cards:

### Fixed Files:
- `commands/chest.js` - Added missing `locked: false` property
- `commands/pull.js` - Added missing `level: 1`, `experience: 0`, and `locked: false` properties
- `utils/MarketSystem.js` - Added missing `experience: 0` property in both purchase and unlist functions

### Cards Created Without Proper Schema:
These fixes ensure all card objects have the complete schema as defined in the User model:
```javascript
{
    name: String,
    rank: String, 
    level: Number (default: 1),
    experience: Number (default: 0),
    timesUpgraded: Number (default: 0),
    locked: Boolean (default: false)
}
```

## Impact

These fixes should resolve:
- Equipment not showing properly for users
- Market purchases failing to deliver items
- Data inconsistency issues between different commands
- Potential save issues with Mongoose Mixed types
- Cards created with incomplete schemas causing undefined property errors
- Consistency across all card creation points in the codebase
