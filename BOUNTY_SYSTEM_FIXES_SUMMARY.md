# Bounty System & Duel Fixes Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Issues Fixed & Features Added

### 1. **Duplicate Messages Issue** ✅ **FIXED**

**Problem**: Messages were being sent twice, causing command spam and confusion.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Enhanced deduplication system with user ID tracking
- Added 5-second timing window verification for interactions
- Improved unique ID generation: `${messageId}-${channelId}-${userId}-${commandName}`
- Added detailed logging for debugging duplicate detection

**Technical Changes**:
- **`index.js`**: Enhanced message and interaction deduplication logic
- Added timestamp verification to prevent false positives
- Improved error handling for duplicate detection

### 2. **Percentage-Based Bounty System** ✅ **NEW FEATURE**

**Requirements Met**:
- ✅ Winner receives **10%** of loser's bounty
- ✅ Loser loses **10%** of their bounty 
- ✅ **3-victory limit** per opponent (no more bounty exchange after 3 wins)
- ✅ Victory tracking persists across sessions

**Example**: User with 10,000 bounty loses to you:
- You gain: **1,000 bounty** (10% of 10,000)
- They lose: **1,000 bounty** (10% of their total)
- Victory count: **1/3** against that player

**Technical Implementation**:
- **`db/models/User.js`**: Added `bountyVictories` field to track wins per opponent
- **`utils/duelHandler.js`**: Complete rewrite of bounty calculation logic
- Victory tracking uses opponent's userId as key
- Prevents bounty farming by limiting wins per player

### 3. **Bounty Command with Target System** ✅ **NEW FEATURE**

**Command**: `op bounty`

**Features**:
- 🎯 **Random Target Assignment**: Gets random player with >1,000 bounty
- ⏰ **24-Hour Cooldown**: Can only reroll once per day
- 🏆 **5x Multiplier**: Defeating bounty target gives **5x normal bounty**
- 🔄 **Auto-Reset**: Cooldown resets immediately when target is defeated
- 📊 **Target Tracking**: Shows current target and potential rewards

**How It Works**:
1. Use `op bounty` to get random target (if no active target or cooldown expired)
2. Target must have at least 1,000 bounty to be eligible
3. Defeat target in duel to get **5x bounty reward** (50% of their bounty instead of 10%)
4. Cooldown resets automatically, can get new target immediately
5. If you don't defeat target, must wait 24 hours for new one

**Example Rewards**:
- Target has 10,000 bounty
- Normal duel win: 1,000 bounty (10%)
- **Bounty target win: 5,000 bounty (50%)**
