# Team Battle System Fix - Complete Report

## Problem Summary
The explore fighting system was using non-existent user stats instead of the team's card stats. This meant:
- Fighting used placeholder user stats instead of actual card power/health/speed
- XP wasn't being distributed to the actual cards in the team
- Team cards weren't participating in battles as intended

## Root Cause
The restored explore.js was using a simplified user-based battle system (`getUserBattleStats()`) instead of the proper team-based card system that other commands like `duel` use.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Proper Battle System Integration**
- ✅ Added imports for `calculateBattleStats`, `calculateDamage`, `resetTeamHP`
- ✅ Added imports for `distributeXPToTeam`, `XP_PER_LEVEL`
- ✅ Replaced user-based stats with team card stats

### 2. **Team-Based Combat**
- ✅ **Team Validation**: Checks for valid team and cards before battle
- ✅ **Proper Stats**: Uses actual card stats from definitions with level scaling
- ✅ **Team HP Tracking**: Battle state now tracks individual team members
- ✅ **Card Attacks**: Team cards attack enemies using their real power stats
- ✅ **Enemy Targeting**: Enemies attack random team members instead of user

### 3. **Battle Display Updates**
- ✅ **Team Members**: Shows all alive team members with HP bars
- ✅ **Level Display**: Shows card levels (e.g., "Luffy (Lv.5)")
- ✅ **Individual HP**: Each card has separate current/max HP tracking
- ✅ **Battle Log**: Shows which specific cards are attacking/being attacked

### 4. **XP Distribution System**
- ✅ **Team XP**: XP rewards now distribute to all team members
- ✅ **Level Ups**: Cards can level up and gain stat bonuses
- ✅ **Proper Scaling**: Uses same stat calculation as other commands
- ✅ **XP Storage**: XP properly saved to card instances in database

### 5. **Item System Updates**
- ✅ **Team Healing**: Health potions heal injured team members
- ✅ **Boost Application**: Attack/defense boosts apply to team
- ✅ **Proper Targeting**: Items target specific cards as intended

## Technical Changes Made

### Battle State Structure
```javascript
// OLD (User-based)
battleState = {
    userHp: 150,
    userMaxHp: 150,
    enemies: [...],
    // ...
}

// NEW (Team-based)  
battleState = {
    userTeam: [
        { name: "Luffy", level: 5, hp: 120, currentHp: 120, power: 45, ... },
        { name: "Zoro", level: 3, hp: 100, currentHp: 85, power: 38, ... }
    ],
    enemies: [...],
    // ...
}
```

### Damage Calculation
```javascript
// OLD
let attackDamage = Math.floor(Math.random() * (userStats.atk - 10) + 10);

// NEW
let attackDamage = calculateDamage(attacker, targetEnemy);
```

### XP Rewards
```javascript
// OLD
user.xp = (user.xp || 0) + finalAmount;

// NEW
await addXP(user, amount); // Distributes to team and handles level ups
```
