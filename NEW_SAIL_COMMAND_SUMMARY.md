# 🌊 New Sail Command - Complete Rewrite

## ✅ What Was Done
**Completely deleted and recreated the sail.js command from scratch** to eliminate all bugs and implement your exact specifications.

## 🌊 New Features Implemented

### Command Format
```
op sail                    # Defaults to East Blue
op sail east blue          # Explicit arc selection
```

### Core Mechanics
- ✅ **No cooldowns** - Infinite grinding capability
- ✅ **Unlock requirement** - Must complete stage 42 (defeat Arlong in East Blue)
- ✅ **Progress tracking** - `sailsCompleted["East Blue"]` counter per user
- ✅ **Interactive combat** - Attack, Items, Flee buttons
- ✅ **Healing items** - Basic/Normal/Max Potions usable in battle
- ✅ **XP distribution** - Awards XP to both player and team cards
- ✅ **Team validation** - Ensures valid team setup before sailing

### 📈 East Blue Reward Scaling (Exactly as Specified)

| Sails | Beli | XP | Items | Enemies |
|-------|------|----|---------| ---------|
| 1-5 | 5-10 | 1-5 | None | 1 Navy Soldier (30 HP) |
| 6-10 | 10-50 | 5-10 | None | 1 Navy Officer (50 HP) |
| 11-20 | 50-100 | 10-15 | Common | 1-3 Navy Soldiers (100 HP) |
| 21-50 | 100-250 | 10-20 | Uncommon | 1-3 Navy Enforcers (100-300 HP) |
| 51+ | 250-500 | 15-30 | Rare/Epic/Legendary | 2-4 Elite Navy (200-500 HP) |
